# the Speech of Steve Jobs



## Speech 1: Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish

A commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005

### Connecting the dots

You can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards, so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever - because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off thee well-worn path, and that will make all the difference.

### Love and loss

I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

It is awful-tasting medicine but I guess the patient needed it.

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

### Death

If you live each day as it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

No one wants to die, even people who want to go to Heaven don't want to die to got there, and yet death is the destination we all share.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
